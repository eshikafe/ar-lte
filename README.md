ngr: Next Generation Radio

4G/5G Radio signal processing in Rust

R&D

Goals
-----------
- Demystify and optimize the 3GPP LTE/NR physical layer signal processing in the most energy-efficient way.
- Implement the 3GPP LTE/5G RAN Technical Specifications in Rust.


Roadmap
------------
- GPGPU-based baseband processing.
- Optimized algorithms for baseband processing.
- Containerized baseband processing unit with Docker.
- DPDK support for s1-U packet processing and forwarding.
